Some of my writing may be out of context, so I wanted to create one piece that spelled out where I am at with regard to Components, Messaging, and FRP.


##Components 
1. All structure in software are defined by components.
  3. Components are not UI, although a UIComponent is possible.
  4. Components are types that have Inputs, and Outputs usually implemented as Actions and Events.
  5. Components do not have public methods or properties.

Components are composed together in a tree structure.
